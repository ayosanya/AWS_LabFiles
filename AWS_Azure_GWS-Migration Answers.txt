ORACLE AND MICROSOFT WORKLOADS ON AWS CLOUD MANAGEMENT
Modernize Microsoft and Oracle Workloads with AWS
MSSQL on Linux RedHat ans Susi from version MSSQL 2017

Any help in moving code from DotNet to ElastickBeanStack
A:
Hello Ayodeji, you are able to leverage the AWS visual studio toolkit to deploy directly, your 
Dot.Net code to Beanstalk or to AWS Lambda

Do you have solutions for products like ERP for SAP, SAGE Oracle Fusion from MSSQL to Arora
A:
With Amazon SCT (Schema Conversion Tool), you can see the compatibility level on a very granular level 
and see what would be required to change in the DB.

Do we get the OnDemand video link after the presentation
Hello, this webinar isn't being recorded, but we will share the slides at the presentation.
Will I get these slides at some point..?
Hi there, yes we will be sharing slides after the presentation

Hi, Is SQL 2008 support also ends in IAAS ?
Yes & no - SQL2008 went end of life last July. We are offering 3 years of "extended support" 
but you have to pay for this *unless* you're runing SQL2008 on Azure then we'll give you the 3 years of 
Extended Support for free. Just to be clear these updates are security patches only - 
no service or performance improvements. So this effectlively extend SQL2008 life to July 2022.

how can I register for other Virtual events like this. this was given by my friend.
Hello. There are some other UK events here you can register : https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/events/

Will this presentation be made available after ?
Yes we will be sharing the slides after

Apologies for the technical difficulties. We are now on a break till 11:15am

Can you give us some advantages of cosmos db over MSSQL in Azure for a refactoring migration over lift and shift
Hi Cosmos is great for massively scalable, globally distributed systems that need to replicate data around the world - 
to bring the data close to the user so it tends to be very different usecast to SQL Server (of any flavour - IaaS or PaaS).
Can we have the link to the presentation slides as I missed the first part of the current training

Does DMS support migrating Windows logins yet, or is it still just SQL logins ?
DMS supports migrating windows Logins in Offline migrations only. You need to configure DMS to do this as by default 
this is disabled. Once you have your DMS service available in Azure, head to the configuration menu to enable.
Can I replay this Demo later please? Sorry I got dragged to do some urgent work for my company whilst watching.
Apologies but this webinar is not being recorded. However, you can view a similar presentation on DMA and DMS with Raj, 
our Principal Programme manager in this link https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/videos/data-migration-demo-using-azure-migrate-dma-and-dms/. 
We will share the slides after the presentation.

Is it possible to retain the connection string (SQL instance name) without applications to change it ?
You have to remember that migrating the DB to a different server so the host name change & break existing connection string 
(just as if you were migrating to a new server on-prem). But you can use: - SQL Aliases - these are configured on the desktop 
and redirect local apps to the new server without changing their conn strings - Speak nicely to the networking guys & see if 
they do a DNS alias for you which saves having to maintain aliases/redirects on each desktop. Hope that helps!

Does DMA change DB compatibility automatically
No - TBH honest it doesn't care about DB compatibility level as such 
- it's a property of the DB and simple tells the host SQL exe 
which version of the engine to use with that database.

What are the intergratable solutions avalaible with Datalake and what maximum workloads are available?
you can connect to Azure Data Lake using the Flexible File Format connector ...

What industrial runtimes are avalaible on SSIS and Datafactory
Sorry, can you clarify Industrial. Or do you mean Integrated?
java runtime....say .net
So we only support SSIS runtime as part of this. But in Azure Data Factory we support different ways to integrate. 
Within SSIS you can call .net but wouldn't see java in this context

Hi We'll be sending the slides out next week with a bunch of other resources/useful links.
